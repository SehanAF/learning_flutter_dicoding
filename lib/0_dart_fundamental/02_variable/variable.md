# Understanding Variables in Dart

## What are Variables?
In programming, variables are used to store and manipulate information such as displaying text on a screen or performing calculations. Think of variables as containers or boxes that hold data in computer memory. Each variable has a unique name, making it easy to reference and use its stored value.

In Dart, variables can be defined using the `var` keyword:

```dart
var greetings = 'Hello Dart!';
```

Here, the `=` symbol is known as the **assignment operator**. The above code assigns the value `'Hello Dart!'` to a variable named `greetings`. This process of assigning a value to a variable is called **initialization**.

---

## Displaying Variables
Once a variable is initialized, its value can be displayed in the console. Let’s modify the main function to print the value of a variable:

```dart
void main() {
  var greetings = 'Hello Dart!';
  print(greetings);
}
```

When you run this program, the output will be:

```
Hello Dart!
```

---

## Storing Numeric Data
Variables in Dart can also store numeric data. Here’s an example of a variable initialized with a number:

```dart
var myAge = 20;
print(myAge);
```

The output will be:

```
20
```

---

## Declaring Variables Without Initialization
If you need to declare a variable without immediately assigning a value, you can do so. This is called **variable declaration**. The variable will reserve memory space but won’t contain any value until it’s initialized later.

Here’s an example:

```dart
void main() {
  var myAge;
  myAge = 20;
  print(myAge);
}
```

This code declares a variable `myAge` without assigning a value, then assigns `20` to it later. When you run the program, it will print:

```
20
```

---

## Default Value of Uninitialized Variables
If you declare a variable but don’t initialize it, Dart assigns it a default value of `null`. Let’s test this by commenting out the variable initialization in the example above:

```dart
void main() {
  var myAge;
  print(myAge); // Outputs: null
}
```

The console will output:

```
null
```

This indicates that the variable `myAge` hasn’t been assigned a value yet.

---

## Specifying Data Types
In Dart, you can also explicitly define the data type of a variable. This ensures that the variable holds a specific type of value (e.g., strings, integers, or doubles). Here are some examples:

### String Data Type
```dart
String greetings = 'Hello, Dart!';
print(greetings);
```

### Integer Data Type
```dart
int myAge = 20;
print(myAge);
```

### Double Data Type
```dart
double price = 19.99;
print(price);
```

---

## Using `final` and `const`
In Dart, you can use the `final` and `const` keywords to declare variables that cannot be changed after they are assigned.

### `final`
A `final` variable can only be assigned once, but its value is determined at runtime:

```dart
void main() {
  final currentTime = DateTime.now();
  print(currentTime);
}
```

### `const`
A `const` variable must have a compile-time constant value. It is evaluated at compile time:

```dart
const pi = 3.14;
print(pi);
```

---

## Variable Scope
Variables have different scopes based on where they are declared:

### Global Variables
Declared outside of all functions and accessible throughout the program:

```dart
var globalVar = 'I am global';

void main() {
  print(globalVar);
}
```

### Local Variables
Declared inside a function and accessible only within that function:

```dart
void main() {
  var localVar = 'I am local';
  print(localVar);
}
```

---

## Best Practices for Variables
- Use meaningful names for variables to make your code more readable.
- Use `final` or `const` for variables that won’t change to prevent accidental modifications.
- Always initialize variables when possible to avoid unexpected `null` values.
- Avoid using overly generic names like `data`, `value`, or `temp` unless necessary.
